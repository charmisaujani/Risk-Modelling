# Probability of Default (PD) Model â€” Credit Risk

## Overview

This project develops and validates a **Probability of Default (PD) model** on a synthetic credit portfolio dataset. It demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of:

- Synthetic data generation  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model training using machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
- Probability calibration using isotonic regression and Platt scaling  
- Model evaluation with metrics such as ROC-AUC, Brier Score, and calibration curves  

The goal is to build a reliable PD model to support credit risk assessment and decision-making.
